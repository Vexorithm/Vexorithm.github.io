### Abstract
Dynamic multimodal optimization problems (DMMOPs) demand algorithms capable of swiftly locating and tracking multiple optimal solutions over time. The primary challenge lies in controlling the population diversity to facilitate effective exploration, all within the limitation of computational resources between consecutive environmental changes. In this paper, we study the utilization of density information derived from both current and historical populations to enhance exploration. First, for each active sub-population, we construct a density landscape based on the distribution of concurrently active sub-populations, and establish dominance relationships between candidate solutions in the sub-population based on density and fitness values, directing this sub-population towards exploring low-density promising areas. Then, for each converged sub-population, we construct a density landscape based on the distribution of sub-populations that have historically become extinct, guiding the restart of this sub-population in low-density unexploited areas. Finally, we develop a comprehensive framework of density-assisted evolutionary algorithm (DAEA), which encompasses density-assisted search and restart, also combined with initialization. Moreover, we employ prediction and memory strategies to enhance the performance of DAEA in dynamic environments. Notably, the algorithm relies on an external monitor to detect environmental changes and trigger the dynamic response strategy. DAEA is tested on the CEC'2022 dynamic multimodal optimization benchmark suite, and is compared against several state-of-the-art dynamic multimodal optimization algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of DAEA in handling DMMOPs.

### Abstract
Recently, many approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), have been proposed to further enrich Large Language Models‚Äô (LLMs) complex problem-solving capacities in reasoning scenarios. However, these methods may fail to solve complex problems due to the lack of ability to find optimal solutions. Swarm Intelligence has been serving as a powerful tool for finding optima in the field of traditional optimization problems. To this end, we propose integrating swarm intelligence into the reasoning process by introducing a novel Agent-based Swarm Intelligence (ASI) paradigm. In this paradigm, we formulate LLM reasoning as an optimization problem and use a swarm intelligence scheme to guide a group of LLM-based agents in collaboratively searching for optimal solutions. To avoid swarm intelligence getting trapped in local optima, we further develop a Swarm Intelligence Enhancing Reasoning (SIER) framework, which develops a density-driven strategy to enhance the reasoning ability. To be specific, we propose to perform kernel density estimation and non-dominated sorting to optimize both solution quality and diversity simultaneously. In this case, SIER efficiently enhances solution space exploration through expanding the diversity of the reasoning path. Besides, a step-level quality evaluation is used to help agents improve solution quality by correcting low-quality intermediate steps. Then, we use quality thresholds to dynamically control the termination of exploration and the selection of candidate steps, enabling a more flexible and efficient reasoning process. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely-used seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks, i.e., MATH-500, MMLU-STEM, etc. As expected, our method consistently outperforms both CoT methods and existing reward-guided approaches, particularly on complex problems. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging swarm intelligence for enhanced reasoning.

### Abstract

Trustworthiness reasoning aims to enable agents in multiplayer games with incomplete information to identify potential allies and adversaries, thereby enhancing decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the graph retrieval-augmented trustworthiness reasoning (GRATR) framework, which retrieves observable evidence from the game environment to inform decision-making by large language models (LLMs) without requiring additional training, making it a zero-shot approach. Within the GRATR framework, agents first observe the actions of other players and evaluate the resulting shifts in inter-player trust, constructing a corresponding trustworthiness graph. During decision-making, the agent performs multi-hop retrieval to evaluate trustworthiness toward a specific target, where evidence chains are retrieved from multiple trusted sources to form a comprehensive assessment. Experiments in the multiplayer game \emph{Werewolf} demonstrate that GRATR outperforms the alternatives, improving reasoning accuracy by 50.5\% and reducing hallucination by 30.6\% compared to the baseline method. Additionally, when tested on a dataset of Twitter tweets during the U.S. election period, GRATR surpasses the baseline method by 10.4\% in accuracy, highlighting its potential in real-world applications such as intent analysis.

### Abstract

To enhance tourists' experiences and immersion, this paper proposes a narrative-driven travel planning framework called NarrativeGuide, which generates a geoculturally-grounded narrative script for travelers, offering a novel, role-playing experience for their journey. In the initial stage, NarrativeGuide constructs a knowledge graph for attractions within a city, then configures the worldview, character setting, and exposition based on the knowledge graph. Using this foundation, the knowledge graph is combined to generate an independent scene unit for each attraction. During the itinerary planning stage, NarrativeGuide models narrative-driven travel planning as an optimization problem, utilizing a genetic algorithm (GA) to refine the itinerary. Before evaluating the candidate itinerary, transition scripts are generated for each pair of adjacent attractions, which, along with the scene units, form a complete script. The weighted sum of script coherence, travel time, and attraction scores is then used as the fitness value to update the candidate solution set. In our experiments, we incorporated the TravelPlanner benchmark to systematically evaluate the planning capability of NarrativeGuide under complex constraints. In addition, we assessed its performance in terms of narrative coherence and cultural fit. The results show that NarrativeGuide demonstrates strong capabilities in both itinerary planning and script generation.
